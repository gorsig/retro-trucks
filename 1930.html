            <h2>REGULATIONS ON TRUCKING</h2>
            <h3>There was a rapid growth in the trucks on the streets in the late 20s on into the 30s.
                <br>
                By 1933, all states had some form of varying truck weight regulation and a trailer that could hold up to
                four cars was available.
                <br><br>
                President Roosevelt saw some regulatory issues in this new industry and in 1935 the Motor Carrier Act
                brought the first safety regulations to the industry.

                The name of the International Motor Company is changed to the Mack Manufacturing Corporation.
            </h2>
            <p>The Mack E series, introduced in 1936, were streamlined, medium-duty trucks with gross vehicle weight
                ratings ranging up to 23,000 lbs.
                The E models were available in both conventional and cab-over-engine configurations and proved
                themselves among the most versatile products ever offered by Mack.

            <h2>1936-1938 - Mack merchandised a series of trucks under the name "Mack Jr."</h2>
            <p>The vehicle was actually built by the Reo Motor Car Company in Lansing, Michigan. The vehicles were built
                according to Mack specifications and were sold through the Mack sales organization. In total, there were
                4,974 chassis built during this time frame.
                <br><br>
                This was the second time in its history that Mack sold a Mack junior chassis. The 1936-1938 units should
                not be confused with the earlier Mack Junior; production on that version began in 1909
