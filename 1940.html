            <h2>Volvo trucks in 1940s</h2>
            <h3>The experience of developing cross-country military vehicles would prove to be of great long-term
                benefit in the design and production of other forms of rough terrain vehicles
                that would be used in areas such as construction. During the late 1940s, production of old-fashioned
                pre-war vehicles increased dramatically.

            <h2>L29C and V - The first heavy-duty diesel truck - on demand</h2>
            <p>The L29 range of trucks was extremely rugged and powerful, but was made in rather small numbers.
                It was natural to take this range as a base when the first powerful heavy-duty diesel truck was
                introduced in 1946,
                initially very much in response to demands from the National Swedish Road Administration,
                which needed a very powerful vehicle that could carry out snow-ploughing in the heavy Swedish winter as
                well as being a basic
                vehicle for construction of roads (the post-war era was a period when there was a great deal of renewal
                of the road network in Sweden).

            <h2>TVC - Progressive vehicles for military use</h2>
            <p>Volvo, being a progressive company with vast (for the day) resources, naturally played a major part in
                providing
                the Swedish armed forces with transport equipment during the period 1939-45.
                The most advanced vehicles were the TVA/TVB and the TVC, all these three vehicles being heavy towing
                vehicles
                for the artillery and anti-aircraft troops.
                <br>
                The TVC was the first all-wheel-drive vehicle ever produced by Volvo.
                It was based on the TVA/TVB, but with two major changes, forward-control design and the addition of
                front-axle drive.

            <h2>LV15 and LV24 - The first Volvo diesel engine...</h2>
            <p>The original plan was to introduce the first diesel engine in 1940, but World War II delayed the
                introduction of the Volvo diesel truck.
                The first Volvo diesel engine was called 'VDA' ('Volvo Diesel engine type A') and was of the
                pre-combustion type like most of the diesel engines of that era.
                Originally, the VDA was planned to be of the more efficient direction-injection type.
