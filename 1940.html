            <h2>Volvo trucks in 1940s</h2>
            <h3>The experience of developing cross-country military vehicles would prove to be of great long-term benefit in the design and production of other forms of rough terrain vehicles
                that would be used in areas such as construction. During the late 1940s, production of old-fashioned pre-war vehicles increased dramatically.

            <h2>L29C and V</h2>
            <p>The L29 range of trucks was extremely rugged and powerful, but was made in rather small numbers. 
                It was natural to take this range as a base when the first powerful heavy-duty diesel truck was introduced in 1946, 
                initially very much in response to demands from the National Swedish Road Administration, 
                which needed a very powerful vehicle that could carry out snow-ploughing in the heavy Swedish winter as well as being a basic 
                vehicle for construction of roads (the post-war era was a period when there was a great deal of renewal of the road network in Sweden).

            <h2>1920 FORD DEPOT HACK</h2>
            <p>A 1920 Depot Hack is fitted with the demountable rims that became available on a broader range of
                vehicles that year.
                The rims allowed for easier flat repair, as the outer rim (which held the tire) could be separated from
                the wheel hub, which remained on the vehicle.
