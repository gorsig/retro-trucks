            <h2>A Look Back at 1960´s Trucks</h2>
            <h3>In the 1960s, the truck was finally crowned transportation king. This was due in no small part to its flexibility and 
                the fact that a national and international road infrastructure was in place that enabled fast, safe and efficient 
                truck transportation.
                The 1960s was, in other words, a good decade for drivers. In Sweden, certified safety cabs were launched on the market.
                Cabs were fitted with rubber suspension systems, drivers enjoyed the benefits of sitting on sprung seats, and 
                the new high F/COE-cabs afforded superb visibility.

            <p>Improvements under the skin
                But in one way it would be incorrect to term the L46/L47 family of trucks as 'medium-duty', 
                since these trucks were very often required to perform astonishingly heavy duties, especially in countries 
                remote from Sweden where these trucks were being produced.

            <h2>L4751 and F85</h2>
            <p>After the success of the light-duty and medium-duty L42/L43 forward-control trucks, 
                Volvo wanted to go ahead and design F trucks in the heavier segment. 
                This created serious discussions within the management and the design department of the company.

            <h2>L4951, F88 and G88</h2>
            <p>The history of the Titan TIPTOP/F88/G88 is extremely exciting. 
                The importance of these truck models to Volvo truck history cannot be overestimated.
                This truck, which was to conquer practically all of the world with the exception of America, 
                was originally intended for America, not for the rest of the world outside America!
